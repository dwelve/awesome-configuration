Install my configuration into your awesome config folder. (Make sure that 
.config exists and .config/awesome does not exist!).

    cd ~/.config
    git clone http://git.sysphere.org/awesome-configs awesome
    git submodule init

Also, make sure that you have the liblua5.1 filesystem library installed.
